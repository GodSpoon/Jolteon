# Jolteon Development Status

## Current Phase: I - Foundation Setup (95% Complete)

### Phase I Progress
- [x] PlatformIO project configured (ESP32-2432S028Rv3)
- [x] LVGL display library integrated (esp32_smartdisplay)
- [x] Core emulation engine ported from Espeon
- [x] Multiple definition errors resolved
- [x] Project compiles successfully
- [x] Display test pattern implemented
- [x] System verification functions added
- [x] LVGL v9 API compatibility fixed
- [x] Proper project structure (Arduino → PlatformIO)
- [ ] **Hardware testing required** - Flash and verify on actual device
- [ ] SD card ROM loading verification
- [ ] Basic CPU emulation runtime testing

### Completed Tasks
- Fixed LVGL configuration and API compatibility issues
- Resolved linker errors with global variable definitions  
- Moved main Arduino file to proper PlatformIO structure
- Added display test pattern functionality
- Set up basic Game Boy display canvas (160x144 → 240x320)
- Integrated esp32_smartdisplay for ESP32-2432S028R
- Ported complete Game Boy emulation core
- Added comprehensive system diagnostics
- Removed all M5Stack dependencies

### Next Steps
1. **URGENT**: Flash firmware to ESP32-2432S028R hardware for testing
2. Verify display test pattern shows correctly  
3. Test ROM loading from SD card
4. Confirm Game Boy emulation runs
5. Move to Phase II touch interface implementation

### Memory Usage
- RAM: 37.3% (122KB/327KB used)
- Flash: 34.5% (678KB/1966KB used)

### Critical Achievement
✅ **Project successfully compiles with no errors** - Ready for hardware testing!

See `PROGRESS_REPORT.md` for detailed technical analysis.

### Next Steps
1. Complete display configuration and testing
2. Port core emulation from Espeon
3. Implement ROM loading system
4. Move to Phase II touch integration

See `docs/phases/01-foundation.md` for detailed tasks.
