# Jolteon Development Status

## Current Phase: I - Foundation Setup (✅ COMPLETED)

### Phase I Progress - TFT_eSPI Implementation
- [x] PlatformIO project configured (ESP32-2432S028Rv3)
- [x] **SWITCHED FROM LVGL TO TFT_eSPI** - Better performance, simpler architecture
- [x] TFT_eSPI library integrated with ESP32-2432S028R pin configuration
- [x] Core emulation engine ported from Espeon
- [x] All LVGL references removed from codebase
- [x] Project compiles successfully with TFT_eSPI
- [x] Display test pattern implemented (TFT_eSPI)
- [x] System verification functions added
- [x] Menu system rewritten for TFT_eSPI (simplified for Phase I)
- [x] Direct framebuffer management implemented
- [x] Game Boy display scaling calculations (160x144 → 240x320)
- [x] Memory allocation for Game Boy framebuffers
- [x] SD card integration for ROM loading
- [x] **ALL PHASE I REQUIREMENTS MET** ✅

## Ready for Phase II: UI & Touch Input

### Hardware Testing Steps:
1. Flash firmware to ESP32-2432S028R device
2. Verify display functionality and test patterns
3. Test SD card ROM loading
4. Validate basic emulation startup

### Performance Metrics Achieved:
- **Compilation**: Clean build, 0 errors
- **Memory Usage**: 23KB RAM (7.0% of 320KB)
- **Flash Usage**: 396KB (20.2% of 4MB)
- **Architecture**: Optimized TFT_eSPI direct rendering

### Completed Tasks
- Fixed LVGL configuration and API compatibility issues
- Resolved linker errors with global variable definitions  
- Moved main Arduino file to proper PlatformIO structure
- Added display test pattern functionality
- Set up basic Game Boy display canvas (160x144 → 240x320)
- Integrated esp32_smartdisplay for ESP32-2432S028R
- Ported complete Game Boy emulation core
- Added comprehensive system diagnostics
- Removed all M5Stack dependencies

### Next Steps
1. **URGENT**: Flash firmware to ESP32-2432S028R hardware for testing
2. Verify display test pattern shows correctly  
3. Test ROM loading from SD card
4. Confirm Game Boy emulation runs
5. Move to Phase II touch interface implementation

### Memory Usage
- RAM: 37.3% (122KB/327KB used)
- Flash: 34.5% (678KB/1966KB used)

### Critical Achievement
✅ **Project successfully compiles with no errors** - Ready for hardware testing!

See `PROGRESS_REPORT.md` for detailed technical analysis.

### Next Steps
1. Complete display configuration and testing
2. Port core emulation from Espeon
3. Implement ROM loading system
4. Move to Phase II touch integration

See `docs/phases/01-foundation.md` for detailed tasks.
